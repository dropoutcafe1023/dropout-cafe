Our people

 Dropout Cafe was founded by four friends who happened to drop out of college and a group of youngsters who have no idea what to do next in their lives. The same young, jobless generation that we are seeing nowadays has changed their own lives in their own ways.
 From dropping out of college to becoming entrepreneurs, these four people actually struggled.
 They are role models for the modern generation. To start up a new coffee shop,it must be hard to get the courage for these young men. Anyway, they started it without any fear; they lacked the fear of society and the fear of becoming successful; they just went for it without any hesitations.

 The starting point

 It all started with those back papers in college. The idea of starting up a coffee shop came from the infinite thoughts that came from thoughts about the future and life. The insults from society and pressure from the family side made us think and do something for the future,for the success that everyone always wanted. So decisions were made, and things started to work practically. First had a little fear like everyone else but moved forward with the courage of four young people, and that made what is now the Dropout Cafe. 
Growing together 
              From nothing to the Dropout Cafe we see today, we grew through many struggles and hard work. From failures to entrepreneurs, we grew. The ones who insulted us and said we were mad and never going to succeed changed their opinions and supported us, which is the biggest achievement we have today. We will continue our journey with your support of you guys along with us.We thank you all with all our hearts. We believe that all of you will be with us on our journey. Thank you.
Commitment to Sustainability and Ethical Practices
In an era characterized by environmental concerns and ethical considerations, demonstrating a commitment to sustainability can be a distinguishing feature. By using eco-friendly materials, sourcing fair-trade coffee beans, and minimizing waste, you can set yourself apart. It is crucial to transparently communicate these efforts to our customers, who increasingly make choices based on our company's values.
A Thoughtful Aesthetic
Crafting a welcoming and aesthetically pleasing environment is fundamental. Dropout cafes are more than just a place to consume caffeine; we are gathering spaces for work, study, or socializing.Our interior design will echo your concept and offer comfortable seating, ample natural light, and a layout that encourages interaction. The color palette, furnishings, and decor should be meticulously selected to create a distinctive ambiance. And most attractively, everyone's favorite fragment of caffeine is one of the special things in our cafe.
 Customer service 
Outstanding customer service is the bedrock of our coffee shop. A well-trained, amicable, and knowledgeable staff is essential. Prompt service, attentiveness, and a warm demeanor can transform first-time visitors into loyal regulars.Only with your support can we go forward.
Digital platforms
In this digital age, we need strong digital platforms to engage with more people. Maintain an informative website and active social media profiles to keep our audience abreast of new offerings, events, and promotions. Encourage user-generated content by sharing customer photos and reviews on your platforms, creating a sense of community both in-store and online.
Conclusion
A truly exceptional coffee shop is an embodiment of craftsmanship and an unwavering commitment to excellence. It's about more than just coffee; it's about creating a memorable experience from the moment customers cross the threshold to the last sip of their beverage.
